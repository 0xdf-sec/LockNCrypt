A Python-based secure file encryption system with Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) using Google Authenticator (TOTP) and SMS OTP verification via Telesign API.

# Features ‚ú®
### Dual-Factor Authentication
- Time-based OTP (Google/Microsoft Authenticator)
- SMS OTP verification (via Telesign API)

### Military-Grade Encryption
- AES-256 CBC mode encryptioN
- Multiple encryption iterations for enhanced security

### User-Friendly GUI
- Built with Tkinter for easy file selection
- Progress bars and real-time feedback

### Security Hardened
- Environment variable configuration
- Input validation and attempt limiting
- Automatic cleanup of temporary files

```
### Usage üöÄ
```bash
Run the application for the first time:
python3 lockncrypt.py
- It will ask you to enter telesign's API key. Customer ID and your phone number.
- After that, the script will create a QR code for the Google/Microsoft authenticator.
```


# Workflow üîÄ
### Authentication üîê
- Scan the generated QR code with Google Authenticator
- Enter the 6-digit TOTP code
- Verify SMS OTP sent to your phone

### File Operations üìÇ
- Choose between encryption/decryption
- Select your file
- Optionally apply multiple encryption rounds

### Output ü©ª
- Encrypted files get .enc extension
- Decrypted files restore original format
